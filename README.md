# Federated_Learning_Project_Visual_Demo


This project simulates a simple **Federated Learning** environment  
using a web-based UI built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The webpage displays:
- 🖥️ A **Server Machine** on the left
- 📱 Two **Android Phones** side-by-side on the right

It visually demonstrates **Local Training**, **Sending Weights**, and **Aggregation** in a federated learning setting!
